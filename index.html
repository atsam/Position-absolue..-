      <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
      <p class="secondp">There is a continuing need to show the power of <span>CSS.
        The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and</span> encourage participation.
        To begin, view some of <span>the existing designs in the list.
        Clicking on any one will </span>  load the style sheet into this very page.
        The HTML <span>remains the same, the only thing that has changed is</span> the external CSS file. Yes, really.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span>CSS allows complete and total control over the style </span>of a hypertext document.
        The only way this can be <span>illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by </span>demonstrating what it can truly be,
         once the reins <span>are placed in the hands of those able to create</span> beauty from structure.
          Designers and coders alike <span>have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can</span> always push it further.

      <p class="thirdp">Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,<span>
         incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="thirdp">We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved <span>
          thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser</span>
          creators.
      </p>
      <p class="thirdp">The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons <span>
         of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored</span>
          techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

      <h2>Participation</h2>
      <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus.<span>
        You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills</span>
        are necessary too, but the example files are <span>
        commented well enough that even CSS novices can</span>
        use them as starting points. Please see the CSS <span>
        Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on</span>
        working with CSS.
      </p>
      <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish,<span>
         but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if</span>
         you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the <span>
        listed links to learn more, and use the sample files</span>
         as a guide.
      </p>
      <p>Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a <span>
        copy locally. Once you have completed your</span>
         masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished <span>
         work) upload your CSS file to a web server under </span>
         your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file <span>
         d all associated assets, and if we</span>
         choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should <span>
        be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be</span>
        provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the <span>
        latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only </span>
        real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have <span>
        implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see </span>
        fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer <span>
        number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in </span>
        mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. <span>
        That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at </span>
        least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by <span>
        over 90% of the population).</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. <span>
        Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate </span>
        unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of <span>
        eeding another garden-related design.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright <span>
        on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we </span>
        ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to the <span>
        one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</span>
